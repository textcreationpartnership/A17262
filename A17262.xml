         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For the feare that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man hath of the power of great perſonages, which holdeth euery man (bee he neuer ſo bold) from vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing vnto them that may

<pb n="221" facs="tcp:7295:132"/>
The ſweete band of friendſhip is an excellent good, the very ſhadow wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (by reaſon of thoſe continuall flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers they haue about them) they cannot promiſe themſelues; It is a great benefit to make proofe of the faith and fidelitie of thoſe they loue, before deare experience bewray their infidelitie, being many times flame by their owne children, their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, their wiues, their neighbours: for which they may thanke their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridled deſire of bearing rule. The peace and quiet of the minde, is an excellent good, whereof they are in ſuch ſort depriued by publicke buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and the many and dayly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of their ſubiects wrongfully op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, that they paſſe ouer whole nights with watchful eyes, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome thoughts, exceeding therein the vnfortunate condition of the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt ſlaues, who after their weariſome trauels in the day, in the middeſt of their chaines and fetters, ſleepe ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſecurely at night.

from iniuries, loſſe of honour, or goods, death of friends, iniuſt perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mighty Princes, treachery of friends, iniuſt iudgments, loſſe of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſenſes: and (that which maketh vp the heape of all theſe griefes) from the vnkindneſſe of thoſe that in the middeſt of them do abandon vs. Which occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſorrow, of how great importance they are, the weakeſt iudgment may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily conceiue. <hi>Or Perhaps,</hi> becauſe the remedies for the griefes of the minde are not ſo eaſily found, as thoſe of the body, and therefore we ſee that a Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgian, or a Phiſician (many times) with a ſmall plaſter healeth a deepe wound, whereas the griefe of the mind, by no manner of means can be ſo much as comforted, much leſſe throughly cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.

For it much more becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a wiſe man, to take much paynes, and to hope little, then to labour ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and yet to bee puffed vp with vaine hopes. <hi>Or Perhaps,</hi> becauſe men for the moſt part chuſing the ende, not withall conſidering their owne forces to attaine that ende, and that which is worſe, not conſulting with fit, &amp; oportune meanes, but being indiffetently carried with a kind of plebeian fury, they indure ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtrange encounters, and vnexpected croſſes in their promiſed hopes.

with them without danger, much leſſe doth hope ſuffice, which hopeth one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that which is ſimply good: nor <hi>Feare,</hi> which flyeth, and dares not incounter a danger.

it is that we ſee them imitate hunting with their runnings, &amp; cries, &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit voyces, and ſnares, and tramells, and the like apiſh imitations. Hence it is, that ſeeing the ordering of great armies, ſkirmiſhes, fightes, and other military exerciſes, they inforce them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues (as much as in them lyeth) to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate them, by making weapons of woode, and canes, and other matter, and enſignes painted, and adorned ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their childiſh manner. Hence it is, that we ſee them counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feite grauity in their paces, audacity in in their countenances, brauery in their bodies, with their ſwordes by their ſides, their poynardes prepared, their gunnes on their ſhoulders, with drum and trumpet, incountring one another, diſcharging their peeces, making ſhew with their handes, but noyſe with their mouthes, letting fall their pikes, ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their battells, taking priſoners, and ranſoming them againe, and what not, that any way apperteyneth to military profeſſion. Hence it is, that we ſee them imitate eloquent men, their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, their pronuntiation, their manner of ſpeech: that we ſee them build them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:7295:164"/>
houſes, and gardens: yea that they imitate the very publike iuſtice, and execution euen to the axe, and the halter. <hi>Or Perhaps,</hi> becauſe man being alured by the delight of imitation, might knowe, that he is borne vnto labour, and hereby euen from his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der yeares accuſtoming himſelfe to the habit of vertue, by thoſe frequent actions, which imitation miniſtreth vnto him, it might not ſeeme ſtrange vnto him, being growne in yeares to follow with generous courage, and hardineſſe, thoſe valiant actes, that crowne their actors with honour and glory: thoſe iuſt actions that mainteine ſtates: wiſe actions, that makes vs wary and prouident: and ſtudious actions, that makes vs immortall.</p>
